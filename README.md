# Web_Scraping
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites or for gathering information from the Internet.

Few important libraries used in the project are: 

1. Request Library - Used to get the web-page content
2. BS4 Library (Beautiful-Soup) - Used for Parsing the HTML code.

URL/API is also used which is required for using the GET and the CONTENT functions to scrape the information(like Hotel name, address and description) from the web-page.

Here we are using the command line argument for improving our Web Scraper project. Python Command line arguments are input parameters passed to the script when executing them. It is always better to enter a few values directly through the command line arguments rather than hard coding them everytime.

Database is used over a CSV file to store the scraped data which makes the Web Scraping Project more dynamic and easier to maintain and access.

This automated web scraping can be a solution to speed up the data collection process.
